## Disclaimer
I am not responsible for any bans that come out of the creation and/or distribution of this mod.
This mod exists for educational purposes only.
## Explanation
About 6 months ago I discovered a check that if flagged permanently bans you from the server.
I made a mod that falsely triggers said check.  Now I am releasing a public version of that mod.
Basically the modid is flagged because it shares an modid with the staff mod and because it's hypixel and it's the staff mod they just instantly perm ban you.
