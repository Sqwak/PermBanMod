## Disclaimer
I am not responsible for any bans that come out of the creation and/or distribution of this mod.
This mod exists for educational purposes only.
## Explanation
About 6 months ago I discovered a check that if flagged permanently bans you from the server.
I made a mod that falsely triggers said check.  Now I am releasing a public version of that mod.

_I'll elaborate later I'm tired_
